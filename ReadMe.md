# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a data science and machine learning project that focuses on identifying customers who are likely to discontinue a service. By analyzing historical customer data, this project helps businesses take proactive steps to improve customer retention.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer retention is a major challenge for many organizations, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn.

---

## 🧠 Approach
The project follows an end-to-end data science workflow:
1. Data understanding and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection and transformation  
5. Machine learning model training  
6. Model evaluation and comparison
